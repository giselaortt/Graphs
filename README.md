# Graphs


ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸English:
I coded this with educational purposes. The goal was to understand in depth how the main graph algorithms work from scratch.
Often in day to day problem solving it is natural to rely on liberies, however if we never code an algorithm from scratch i feel we do not own it.
This project was corrected by a university professor and I got full marks. The only problem with it is a memory leak, wich althoug I have puted the best of my efforts to review it several times, I could not identify it's cause.

### Implemented:
- Dinamical priority queue (heap)
- Union Find
- Kruskall
- depth first search
- Prim

### not implemented:
- bfs 
- dekstra
